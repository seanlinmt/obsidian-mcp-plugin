# Obsidian MCP Plugin (enhanced privacy version)

Forked from [https://github.com/aaronsb/obsidian-mcp-plugin](https://github.com/aaronsb/obsidian-mcp-plugin)

📦 **[Available in the Obsidian Community Plugin directory →](https://community.obsidian.md/plugins/semantic-vault-mcp)**

**Give AI semantic agency over your knowledge graph**

This plugin connects your Obsidian vault to AI assistants through MCP (Model Context Protocol), giving them the ability to understand and navigate your notes as a connected knowledge graph, not just isolated files. Through semantic hints and graph traversal, AI gains the agency to explore concepts, follow connections, and synthesize information across your entire vault.

**MCP (Model Context Protocol)** is the open standard that lets AI assistants interact with external tools and data sources. This plugin works with any MCP-compatible client including:
- Claude Desktop (Anthropic)
- Claude Code/Continue.dev (VS Code)
- Any platform that supports local MCP servers

## Why Semantic MCP?

Traditional file access gives AI a narrow view - one document at a time. This plugin transforms that into **semantic agency**:

- **Graph Navigation**: AI follows links between notes, understanding relationships and context
- **Concept Discovery**: Semantic search finds related ideas across your vault
- **Contextual Awareness**: AI understands where information lives in your knowledge structure
- **Intelligent Synthesis**: Combine fragments from multiple notes to answer complex questions

## Quick Start

**Prerequisites:** You need an MCP-compatible AI client like Claude Desktop, Claude Code, or Continue.dev.

### 1. Install the Plugin

**Via Obsidian Community Plugins**
- Open Settings → Community plugins → Browse
- Search for "Semantic Notes Vault MCP"
- Install and enable — or install straight from the [plugin listing](https://community.obsidian.md/plugins/semantic-vault-mcp)

**Via BRAT** (for beta testing)
- Install [BRAT](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat)
- Add beta plugin: `aaronsb/obsidian-mcp-plugin`

### 2. Configure Your AI Client

Three onboarding paths, ordered by audience. All three are also shown in the plugin's Settings tab with copy-ready values.

**Claude Desktop — one-click `.mcpb` install (recommended)**

Download `obsidian-mcp-<version>.mcpb` from the [latest release](https://github.com/aaronsb/obsidian-mcp-plugin/releases/latest), then either drag it onto the Claude Desktop window or double-click it. Claude Desktop opens an install dialog with two fields — paste the URL and API key shown in the plugin's Settings tab, hit Save, and you're done.

> *Cross-platform note:* `.mcpb` files install via Claude Desktop's bundled handler. If double-click doesn't trigger Claude on your system, drag the file onto Claude Desktop's window instead, or right-click → "Open with…" and pick Claude Desktop (then "always open with" if your OS asks). Behavior varies by platform: macOS usually auto-associates, Windows may need a one-time association, Linux varies by desktop environment.

**Claude Code (CLI)**

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http obsidian http://localhost:3001/mcp --header "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

**Other MCP clients (Cline, Continue, custom integrations, multi-vault setups)**

Add an entry to the client's MCP config file — one entry per vault if you run multiple Obsidian instances on different ports:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "obsidian-vault": {
      "transport": {
        "type": "http",
        "url": "http://localhost:3001/mcp",
        "headers": {
          "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Advanced: custom `.mcpb` per vault**

For multi-vault setups that want one-click install per vault, clone this repo and run the maker:

```bash
node scripts/make-mcpb.mjs
# Prompts for display name, URL, and API key
# Outputs obsidian-mcp-<slug>.mcpb with everything pre-filled
```

Drop the resulting bundle into Claude Desktop and click Install — no fields to type.

### 3. Start Using

Once connected, simply chat with your AI assistant about your notes! For example:
- "What are my recent thoughts on project X?"
- "Find connections between my psychology and philosophy notes"
- "Summarize my meeting notes from this week"
- "Create a new note linking my ideas about Y"

Your AI assistant now has these capabilities:
- Navigate your vault's link structure
- Search across all notes semantically
- Read, edit, and create notes
- Analyze your knowledge graph
- Work with Dataview queries (if installed)
- Manage Obsidian Bases (database views)

## Core Tools

The plugin provides 8 semantic tool groups that give AI comprehensive vault access:

| Tool | Purpose | Key Actions |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **📁 vault** | File operations | list, read, create, search, move, split, combine |
| **✏️ edit** | Content modification | window editing, append, patch sections |
| **👁️ view** | Content display | view files, windows, active note |
| **🕸️ graph** | Link navigation | traverse, find paths, analyze connections |
| **💡 workflow** | Contextual hints | suggest next actions based on state |
| **📊 dataview** | Query notes | Execute DQL queries (if installed) |
| **🗃️ bases** | Database views | Query and export Bases (if available) |
| **ℹ️ system** | Vault info | Server status, commands, web fetch |

## The Semantic Advantage

This plugin doesn't just give AI access to files - it provides **semantic understanding**:

### Example: Research Assistant
```
User: "Summarize my research on machine learning optimization"

AI uses semantic tools to:
1. Search for notes with ML optimization concepts
2. Traverse graph to find related papers and techniques  
3. Follow backlinks to discover applications
4. Synthesize findings from multiple connected notes
```

### Example: Knowledge Explorer
```
User: "What connections exist between my notes on philosophy and cognitive science?"

AI uses graph tools to:
1. Find notes tagged with both topics
2. Analyze shared concepts via graph traversal
3. Identify bridge notes that connect domains
4. Map the conceptual overlap
```

## Features

### Semantic Search
- Advanced query operators: `tag:`, `path:`, `content:`
- Regular expressions and phrase matching
- Relevance ranking and snippet extraction

### Graph Intelligence
- Multi-hop traversal with depth control
- Backlink and forward-link analysis
- Path finding between concepts
- Tag-based navigation

### Content Operations
- Fuzzy text matching for edits
- Structure-aware modifications (headings, blocks)
- Batch operations (split, combine, move)
- Template support

### Integration
- Dataview query execution
- Bases database operations
- Web content fetching
- Read-only mode for safety
